# ML_Addition

This project teaches a machine learning model how to do addition. 

I am teaching myself about machine larning on my own and wanted to try something fun. So I followed Valerio Velardo's "The Sound of AI"
youtube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdXxaZcQer8&list=PL-wATfeyAMNrtbkCNsLcpoAyBBRJZVlnf&index=9)
to complete this quick project. 

The specific model that we trained is a multilayer perceptron machine learning model.

Thanks!
